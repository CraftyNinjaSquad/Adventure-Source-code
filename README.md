This was a game I had created as a final for a game dev class. The assignment was to create a game from sctratch using Pygame. My plan for this assignment was to use a previous assignment as inspiration for the game. This previous assignment was to create a text-based adventure.
Using that as the base for the final, I added graphics and turned it into a top-down dungeon crawl similar to a classic Zelda game. The route and way of beating the dungeon are the same as well.

Some issues I ran into during the creation of this was the fact that when I loaded the game, it registered interactions instantly before any inputs could be made, causing the player to change rooms every frame. After adding a check to make sure all assets were placed in the room properly before registering interactions that issue was fixed.
Another bug I ran into but decided to keep as a secret feature, was there was a way to skip to the final phase of the boss by just running into it with your shield at the very start.\

I was very proud of myself for creating this and enjoyed the entire process of making it.
